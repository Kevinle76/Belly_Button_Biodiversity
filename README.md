# Belly_Button_Biodiversity
## Background:
In this assignment, we will build an interactive dashboard to explore the [Belly Button Biodiversity dataset](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/), which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

Methods for Analysis:

1. Utilized data:  https://2u-data-curriculum-team.s3.amazonaws.com/dataviz-classroom/v1.1/14-Interactive-Web-Visualizations/02-Homework/samples.json

2. Libraries utilized:Plotly, D3

3. Create bar chart.

4. Create bubble chart

5. Display the sample metadata.

6. Update all the plots when a new sample is selected, deploy the app to a free static page hosting service.

7. Adapt the Gauge Chart.
